# Exam Management System

Welcome to our Exam Management System! This system streamlines the process of conducting exams and evaluating student submissions using Python scripts.

## Files

1. **QP.xlsx**: This is the question paper file provided to students. It is password-protected with the password: RLRKV2023. Students write their answers in the designated column (Column S).

2. **exam_correction.py**: This Python script is used to evaluate student submissions. It processes the submissions stored in QP.xlsx and generates grades for each student.

## Usage

1. **Secure Exam Delivery**: Distribute the QP.xlsx file to students via pendrive. Provide them with the password to access the file.

2. **Student Submissions**: Students write their answers in the designated column (Column S) of QP.xlsx.

3. **Evaluation**: Run the exam_correction.py script to evaluate student submissions. The script will process the submissions and generate grades for each student.

4. **Grading**: The results are stored in a CSV file for easy analysis by educators. Each student's grade is associated with their ID number for anonymity.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the QP.xlsx file and the exam_correction.py script from this repository. Follow the instructions provided above for secure exam delivery, student submissions, evaluation, and grading.
